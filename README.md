# Ferret Frenzy
#### Developed by [Madison Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonannewright/)

This is a simple browser game that I began working on during Global Game Jam 2020. Because I organized and ran [UNC Chapel Hill Global Game Jam 2020](http://uncglobalgamejam.web.unc.edu/), I was busy for most of the event and did not have the full 48 hours to make a game like other jammers did. However, I decided to start a game that I would finish later as a side project.

## Game Design

### Summary
This game is based on my two energetic ferrets, Ghost and Grey Wind. They frequently get themselves into trouble by tearing up piddle pads, not using their litter boxes, and attacking my shoes. However, they are also adorable and run around like five year olds who have had too much caffeine.

They freely roam my kitchen, which contains their cage and toys. The game board is based on the floor plan of my apartment, which I found on my apartment's website. The goal of the game is to complete as many tasks as possible before the time runs out, much like Diner Dash. Each round is more difficult than the last.
